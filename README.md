<h3 align="center">Variants of <i>TP53</i> causing Breast Cancer</h3>

  <p align="center">
    Project Overview
  </p>
  <p align ="justify">
    <b>Areas of Interest:</b> 
    <br/>1. Variants of <i>TP53</i> causing Breast Cancer.
    <br/>2. Variant allele frequency of <i>TP53</i>.
    <br/>3. Longitudinal study of <i>TP53</i> variants.
    <br/>4. Exploration of <i>TP53</i> variant interactions with other genes or pathways implicated in Breast Cancer development.
    <br/><b>Problem Statement: </b>
    <br/>In the realm of cancer research, accurately identifying mutations (also known as variants) from next-generation sequencing of tumor samples poses a significant challenge. Variants exhibit diverse characteristics within the dataset, and both biological and technical variability complicate the process for variant callers. Various metrics, such as sequencing depth around the variant, the count of reads supporting the reference or mutated allele, the quality associated with these reads, and the confidence level of the tools in making specific calls, are crucial for assessing variants. This project will specifically explore the utility of one such metric: Variant Allele Frequency (VAF), in addressing these challenges.
    <br/><b>Proposed Data Science strategy:</b>
    <br/> ClinVar -> ClinVar submission from variant curation
